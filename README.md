# Statistical Rethinking
Statistical rethinking is an introductory course on Bayesian data analysis and causal inference, offered by Richard McElreath.

The course is accompanied by a [textbook](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/), a yearly [lecture series](https://youtu.be/FdnMWdICdRs) and [repo](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2023), another [accompanying repo](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking) that has all the R code, and some community resources that translate the code to other languages & libraries. 

Specifically, there is a complete [PyMC translation](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc-resources/tree/main/Rethinking_2) created by the community. However, upon an initial run of some of those notebooks, I found a lot of outdated stuff, such as deprecated functions, and even deprecated supporting packages. A lot of the code there might not be reusable since PyMC has changed over the years. Hence, here I have been working on a new PyMC translation that reflects the latest version (v5). And more importantly, I as a frequentist by default, do value this as a great learning experience, so that my toolkit of modeling things can grow.  

# Plans
I am rolling out the jupyter notebooks chapter by chapter, with an aim for completeness (should include the majority of the code from the original book) and coherency (a first-time reader should have a basic idea of what the code does). I am not strictly following the chapter-wise order since I do not value some of the early chapters as high as the remaining ones. 

# Extra
And here are the [ongoing notes](https://web.goodnotes.com/s/8ERStxgngckNf2VWF4FujP#page-6) I have been taking when listening to the 2023 lectures. Again I skipped the first few chapters there, and they tend to be way ahead of the jupyter notebooks.
