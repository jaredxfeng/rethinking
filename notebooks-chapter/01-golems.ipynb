Falsification is not logical, but some textbooks misrepresent the history (of arguments) so it appears like logical falsification.

Bayesian data analysis takes a question in the form of a model and uses logic to produce an answer in the form of probability distributions. Why does the Bayesian way make more sense? When Galileo first discovered the ring of Saturn with a primitive telescope, he observed some blob, not the clear shape (uncertainty). The sampling procedure here is always deterministic, but the blob always existed there until greater technology came into being. The resampling way of thinking does not make sense, but we can still use probability to help modeling the uncertain shape of Saturn.\n",
